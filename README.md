Kaggle data set here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10/data
Download the csv, train and test folders and unzip them to the same directory as the cifar_train.py file

NOTE: You will need to change the location of the model in cifar_train.py where you see  saver.save(session, 'C:\\Users\\kenny\\Desktop\\CS4660\\cifar-100\\cifar-100-model')


You can run the already trained model on an image in predict.py. Just pass the path of the image to the predict
